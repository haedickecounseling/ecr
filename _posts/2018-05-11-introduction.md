This repository is a database to publicly share (open source) data and research being conducted regarding the potential relationship between 
psychiatric diagnois ([DMS V](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm)) and attachment style (e.g statistically significant 
correlation to both anxiety and avoidance in close relationships).

Correlations *(r)* and signficant *(p)* values will be computed from the [raw data](/files/raw_data.txt) using [a software script](/files/ecr.r) written in the [R Programming Languge](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

Please note that any data samples and documented 
results found within this page or repository are 
tentative and intended for archival purposes only.  

A full analysis and official results will be 
submitted for publication and posted herein 
accordingly one an approriate sample size has been 
reached.
